description: I should never run git add, git commit, or any similar version
  control commands. I can prepare changes, document them, and present them to
  the user for review, but the final commit decision and execution must be the
  user's choice.

Never commit anything to version control myself. Always prepare changes and let the user review and commit them manually.
