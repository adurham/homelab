## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Coding Standards and Conventions

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: 
   - Use Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
   - Follow modular structure with variables and outputs
   - Maintain sensitive data in separate files (not committed to repo)

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Ansible playbooks follow standard structure
   - Use roles for organizing configuration logic
   - Keep secrets out of version control

3. **Smart Home Automation**:
   - YAML configuration files with proper formatting
   - Python scripts for complex automation logic
   - Automated testing and validation

4. **System Management**:
   - Bash scripts with proper error handling
   - Cross-platform compatibility considerations
   - Shell script best practices (set -euo pipefail)

### Testing Approach

1. **Infrastructure**:
   - Use `terraform plan` to review changes before applying
   - Validate variable files before deployment
   - Test in non-production environments first

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Run Ansible playbooks with `--check` mode to preview changes
   - Test on individual hosts before large-scale deployment

3. **Home Assistant**:
   - Validate YAML configurations with `yaml` command
   - Use Home Assistant's built-in validation features
   - Deploy changes in safe environments first

### Build and Deployment Process

1. **Infrastructure**:
   - Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
   - Plan deployment: `terraform plan`
   - Apply configuration: `terraform apply`

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Run playbooks with: `ansible-playbook <playbook.yml>`
   - Use tags for targeted deployments

3. **Home Assistant**:
   - Deploy configurations with automated scripts
   - Use backup mechanisms during deployments

### Contribution Guidelines

1. **Code Review**: All changes should be reviewed before merging
2. **Documentation**: Update documentation when making significant changes
3. **Testing**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Security**: Never commit sensitive data to version control

## üîß Key Concepts

### Domain-Specific Terminology

1. **VMware vSphere**: Virtualization platform for managing virtual machines and resources
2. **Tanium**: Enterprise endpoint security and management platform
3. **NSX**: Network virtualization and security platform 
4. **Consul**: Service discovery and configuration management tool
5. **Vault**: Secrets management and encryption system
6. **Keycloak**: Identity and access management platform
7. **Home Assistant**: Open-source home automation platform

### Core Abstractions

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: 
   - Terraform modules for reusable infrastructure components
   - Variable-based configuration management

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Ansible roles for organizing system configurations
   - Inventory-based targeting of systems

3. **Smart Home Automation**:
   - Occupancy-based triggers and controls
   - Integration with home automation systems

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Modular Infrastructure**: Terraform modules for components like Tanium clients, Active Directory
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Bootstrap scripts that work across macOS, Linux distributions, and Windows
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between infrastructure, configuration, and application layers
4. **Security by Design**: Sensitive data handled through variables and proper file permissions

## üìù Common Tasks

### Step-by-Step Guides for Frequent Development Tasks

#### 1. Deploying New Infrastructure

1. Modify Terraform configuration files in `terraform/`
2. Update variables in `terraform/variables.tf` or `.tfvars` files
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory
4. Run `terraform plan` to review changes
5. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure

#### 2. Installing Tanium Client on New VMs

1. Tag new VMs in VMware vSphere with appropriate tags
2. Run the Ansible playbook: 
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook ansible/playbook_install_tanium_client.yml
   ```
3. Verify client installation on target systems

#### 3. Restoring Terminal Environment

1. Run the bootstrap script:
   ```bash
   ./misc/scripts/bootstrap.sh
   ```
2. The script will detect your OS and install appropriate packages
3. Configure shell with Oh My Zsh and Starship prompt

#### 4. Updating Home Assistant Configuration

1. Make changes to configuration files in `homeassistant/`
2. Validate configurations with:
   ```bash
   # Use Home Assistant's validation features or YAML linting tools
   ```
3. Deploy changes using the automated deployment scripts

#### 5. Managing Tanium Security Operations

1. Use the Tanium management scripts in `misc/scripts/tanium/`
2. Examples include MD5 index fixing for database security
3. Follow proper authentication procedures for Tanium API access

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Their Solutions

1. **Terraform Configuration Issues**:
   - Error: "Invalid variable value" - Check that all required variables are set in `terraform.tfvars`
   - Error: "Permission denied" - Ensure you have appropriate permissions for vCenter and NSX

2. **Ansible Playbook Failures**:
   - Error: "Host not found" - Verify that VMs are tagged correctly in vSphere inventory
   - Error: "Authentication failed" - Check credentials in Ansible inventory or variables

3. **Home Assistant Deployment Issues**:
   - Error: "Configuration invalid" - Validate YAML with `yaml` command or Home Assistant's config validation
   - Error: "Backup failed" - Ensure backup directory has proper permissions

4. **Bootstrap Script Issues**:
   - Error: "Command not found" - Ensure the script has execute permissions (`chmod +x bootstrap.sh`)
   - Error: "Package manager not found" - Verify that the OS is supported by the bootstrap script

### Debugging Tips

1. **Infrastructure**:
   - Use `terraform show` to view the current state
   - Check logs in VMware vSphere for detailed error information

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Use `ansible-playbook -vv` for verbose output to debug issues
   - Test individual roles before running full playbooks

3. **Home Assistant**:
   - Check logs in Home Assistant's log viewer
   - Use the "Check Configuration" feature in the UI
