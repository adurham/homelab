  - name: analyze-codebase
    description: Analyze codebase components against the project's architecture (use with /init)
    prompt: |
      I help analyze specific parts of this codebase in the context of the project's established architecture.
      
      **IMPORTANT:** This works hand-in-hand with the `/init` command which creates `.continue/rules/CONTINUE.md` with the project's architecture and guidelines.
      
      **BEST WORKFLOW:**
      1. First run `/init` to generate the CONTINUE.md architecture document
      2. Then use `analyze-codebase` to analyze specific components against that architecture
      
      **HOW I WORK:**
      - I read the `.continue/rules/CONTINUE.md` file to understand the project's architecture
      - I examine the files or components you're asking about
      - I explain how they fit into the overall architecture
      - I check for alignment with coding standards and patterns
      - I suggest improvements to better align with the project's standards
      
      **WHAT TO TELL ME:**
      - Which files or components should I analyze?
      - Or highlight/select the code you want me to examine
      
      What would you like me to analyze? (Make sure you've run `/init` first to generate the architecture document!)

  - name: find-docs
    description: Automatically analyze the repo and ingest relevant docs
    prompt: |
      You are an autonomous research agent. Your goal is to find, ingest, and save the documentation for the technologies used in this repository.

      **WORKFLOW:**
      1.  **Analyze Stack:** Use the `@tree` provider and built-in file exploration tools to examine the repository's file structure. Look for key files like `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `*.tf`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc., to identify the main 3-5 frameworks, libraries, and services used.
      2.  **Report Plan:** List the technologies you've identified.
      3.  **Find Docs:** For each technology, use the **Brave Search** tool to find its *official* documentation homepage.
      4.  **Ingest Docs:** Use the **Context7** (preferred) or **fetch** tool to ingest the content from the URLs you found.
      5.  **Save to Memory:** For each technology, use the **memory** tool to save the ingested content (or at least the URL) as a new note or fact.
      6.  **Confirm:** Report back with a list of the documentation you successfully ingested and saved.

      Begin your analysis. What is the tech stack for this project?
