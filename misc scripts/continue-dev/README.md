# Continue.dev Setup Guide: Cursor-like AI Functionality

This guide helps you set up Continue.dev VSCode extension to replicate Cursor's AI agent functionality with support for both local and cloud AI models.

## üéØ What You'll Get

- **Autonomous AI Agent**: Like Cursor's agent mode, can analyze codebases, generate code, debug issues, and execute terminal commands
- **Multiple AI Models**: Support for both local (Ollama) and cloud (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) models
- **Advanced Custom Commands**: 10 specialized commands that replicate Cursor's functionality
- **Codebase Understanding**: Full project context awareness for intelligent suggestions
- **Privacy Options**: Use local models for sensitive code without sending data to external services

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Run the Setup Script
```bash
./setup-continue-dev.sh
```

This will:
- Install Continue.dev VSCode extension
- Install Ollama (if not present)

## üéØ Smart Model Selection Workflow

### How It Works
1. **Run a smart command** (e.g., `cursor-agent`, `smart-debug`)
2. **AI analyzes your task** and recommends the optimal model
3. **You click to switch** to the recommended model (one click)
4. **AI proceeds** with the task using the model's strengths

### Smart Command Strategy
- **`cursor-agent`**: Main command - analyzes any task and recommends best model
- **`smart-code-gen`**: Always recommends CodeLlama 70B for code generation
- **`smart-debug`**: Always recommends DeepSeek Coder 33B for debugging
- **`smart-refactor`**: Always recommends Llama 3.1 70B for complex refactoring
- **`quick-fix`**: Always recommends Qwen2.5 Coder 32B for fast fixes

### Command Usage
1. **Open Continue**: `Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Continue: Open Continue"
2. **Run Smart Command**: `Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Continue: Run Custom Command" ‚Üí Select smart command
3. **Switch Models**: Click the recommended model name in Continue chat
4. **Tab Autocomplete**: Already automatic with CodeLlama 13B

### Best Practices (M4 Max Optimized)
- **Start with `cursor-agent`**: Let it analyze and recommend the best model
- **Use specific commands**: When you know the task type (debug, code-gen, etc.)
- **Trust the recommendations**: The AI knows which model is best for each task
- **Provide context**: Open relevant files before using commands
- **Be specific**: Give detailed instructions for better results
- **Review changes**: Always review AI-generated code before committing
- **Your 36GB RAM**: Can easily handle any recommended model

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Model Configuration
Add your own models to `~/.continue/config.json`:

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "Custom Model",
      "provider": "ollama",
      "model": "your-custom-model",
      "apiBase": "http://localhost:11434"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Context Providers
Enable additional context providers for better understanding:
- `codebase-search`: Search entire codebase
- `git`: Git history and changes
- `terminal`: Terminal output and commands
- `diff`: File differences
- `folder`: Directory structure

### Tab Autocomplete
Configure real-time code suggestions:
```json
{
  "tabAutocompleteModel": {
    "title": "CodeLlama 70B (Ollama)",
    "provider": "ollama",
    "model": "codellama:70b"
  }
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Extension not loading**:
- Restart VSCode
- Check extension is installed: `code --list-extensions | grep continue`

**Models not working**:
- Check Ollama is running: `ollama list`
- Verify API keys are correct
- Check model names match exactly

**Slow responses**:
- Use smaller models for faster responses
- Check internet connection for cloud models
- Ensure sufficient system resources for local models

**Memory issues with local models**:
- Use smaller models (Qwen2.5 Coder 32B instead of 70B)
- Increase system swap space
- Close other applications
